## Why?
Medical professionals often have the task to select one or more diagnoses, reasons for encounter, treatments, etc. in user interfaces.

## What is the ICD? 
For more than a century, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) has been the basis for comparable statistics on causes of mortality and morbidity between places and over time. ICD serves a broad range of uses globally and provides critical knowledge on the extent, causes and consequences of human disease and death worldwide via data that is reported and coded with the ICD. Clinical terms coded with ICD are the main basis for health recording and statistics on disease in primary, secondary and tertiary care, as well as on cause of death certificates. These data and statistics support payment systems, service planning, administration of quality and safety, and health services research. Diagnostic guidance linked to categories of ICD also standardizes data collection and enables large scale research.

## ICPC
ICPC (International Classification of Primary Care) classifies patient data and clinical activity in the domains of General/Family Practice and primary care, taking into account the frequency distribution of problems seen in these domains. It allows classification of the patientâ€™s reason for encounter (RFE), the problems/diagnosis managed, interventions, and the ordering of these data in an episode of care structure
